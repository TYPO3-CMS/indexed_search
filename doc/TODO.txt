- Improve lexer:
	- See BASIC_LEXER from Oracle
	- CJK hack from Zope.
	- Test
	- Implement in search query analysis.
- TESTING with russian, danish, chinese, japanese etc...
- CVS

**************'

- Index Configurations / CLI indexer
- Proper skinning? / getLL? / XHTML
-------------------------------

CRAWLER:
&L=[_TABLE:sys_language;_PID:0:_tx_indexedsearch_fields:bodytext,header]
&[_LOGIN]=[,kasper,francis;_PID:]
&myext[uid]=[1-34,35,36-10]&another=1?
(cache mgm / crawler / publishing)
-> parameters "_TABLE" can instruct indexed_Search which table to index records from!
-> default is flush, INHERIT can
-> crawler gets result back?
	- cached?
	- parsetime?
	- strlen?




************************************************************

Templating / Display in plugin:
- Localization, configuration of search-options, stylesheet formatting of result content (with new CSS Stylesheet Editor)
- Templating
	- with Template Voila TOs?
	- other approaches? (markers seem straight forward)
- linkPage() function
	- Link correctly to MP links / external documents?
	- Link correctly to external documents / URLs?
- CHECK: Which keys are necessary??? There are four keys on typo3.com. Are they all used by the indexer or what?
- Is result links working for frames? (&type=1) See Message-ID: <3DA762A0.84BDA4F1@kuehn.com>
- Implement Stop-words in search

Clean up backend modules:
	- getLL()
	- skinning()
	- XHTML()

Misc:
- DOC: Tutorial on setting it up, getting it to run, trouble shoot it.
- add possibility of cron-job based crawler-indexing of any external site (based on configuration record in the page tree. Access to that page will determine whether external URL is part of result. Just like the external media is.)
- flags i pages tabel: set_for_indexing (reset when indexed), do not index, ...
- The Tools>Indexing module could need some shining up and more useful features (Someone else does this?)
- CLI til removal of old indexes: First set flag, then 14 days later remove the records.
