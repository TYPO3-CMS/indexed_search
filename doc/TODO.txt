- add searching in additional individual tables - non-indexed though (just comfortably "all-in-one" search)
- add API for indexing a string which is passed by an extension (eg. the bodytext of a news-plugin). 
  - Attached to this string might be information of which link could display it. For instance, it could be the page id + which parameter string to append.
  - API for searching in this indexed content ONLY -> in other words an advanced search engine for records.
- add possibility of cron-job based crawler-indexing of any external site (based on configuration record in the page tree. Access to that page will determin whether external URL is part of result. Just like the external media is.)
- add possibility of indexing off non-cached page content which is re-indexed based on a time-interval.
- flags i pages tabel: set_for_indexing (reset when indexed), do not index, ...
- Localization, configuration of search-options, stylesheet formatting of result content (with new CSS Stylesheet Editor)
- Templating with Template Voila TOs?
- Metaphone algorithm which works with foreign languages (Double-metaphone function? Rene suggested...)
- More helperapps for RTF, SXW, Excel, ?
- Faster linkPage() function
- CHECK: Which keys are necessary??? There are four keys on typo3.com. Are they all used by the indexer or what?
- Add support for windows versions of PDF/CATdoc (Message-ID: <6B9653C74CC1D41199CF00508BFCA65D90A7E0@nt-server4.tab.lan>). Notice: Catdoc only takes 8.3 filenames.
- Indexing content from other charsets (probably this is about splitting the local chars, currently only danish/german) Message-ID: <006f01c325ca$b39eb4d0$0100a8c0@FORTRESS>
- Is result links working for frames? (&type=1) See Message-ID: <3DA762A0.84BDA4F1@kuehn.com>

- DOC: Tutorial on setting it up, getting it to run, trouble shoot it.
