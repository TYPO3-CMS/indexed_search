Visning af indhold i backend module skal konverteres fra utf-8 til lokalt charset.

Search test:
- "message appears" - viste external media som IKKE var indekseret!?
- external media respect privacy of pages?
- external media on multiple pages with DIFFERENT languages?
- checkResume: Should it also check for gr_list "0,-1"?
- case-sensitivity?
- Warning: phash-row "114682730" didn't have a representation in the index_section table! on references page! (typo3site_live)

XHTML i frontend?

Backend modules:
- Proper skinning? / getLL? / XHTML

Implement stop-word setting in: ""Top-20 words by count:" and a list seperate from that (in main module?)
- Display filters:
	- The checkbox "No Search" in the page header is only respected by indexed_search during indexing! (A page will not be indexed when "No Search" is set). However when searching results are not filtered based on this flag - so if a page is indexed before the no search flag is set it will be found in search results. To change this is hard because the getTreeList() function that fetches all page ids cannot take a where-clause to filter it out but must have hardcoded support. Alternatively the pages table must be joined into the search result so we can select on the field. A solution is still not agreed upon.
	- For tt_news with access restricted records: don't show the title of page since it can reveal information
		SOLUTIONS: Maybe just hide search results where "resume" is normally just not shown?

Unittest for t3lib_cs converting Euc/shift_jis

- Søgning i tabeller (reg. tabeller!)
	- Alternative presentationer af når records er indexerede.
	- incl. meta-data?
	- Tabelvælger som en del af sektionsvælgeren
- Support for visning i extra niveaer?




Test kaniner (indexed search / caching?):
	- 3DS
	- TYPO3.org copy
	- Metropol
	- FI
	- Link Factory
	- Brunata

**************
getLL with XML-support?


CLI:
- Removal of old indexes
	- delete results with large tstamp (thats all....)
- Indexing configurations
	- (Indexing of records from tables should be done automatically in TCEmain with a hook for create/update/delete)
	- Look up all index configurations
	- Look up phash records (field tstamp) based on config-uid
		- For files: read files from directories, compare mtime with records;
		- For URLs: Forced
		- For records: read records
			- All new files are indexed, all old are removed, all changed are re-indexed

TODO / projects:
*****************

Documentation:
- Configuration possibilities (piVars, TypoScript, Hooks etc)
- How to setup up, analyse and debug indexed search (manual)
- Technical:
	- utf-8 internally.
	- Updates on tables structure

Statistics module:
- Someone write a statistics display module for the search operation! (Displaying content from index_stat_search and index_stat_word)
	Olivier Dobberkau / dkd is on this.

Various:
- The Tools>Indexing module could need some shining up and more useful features (Someone else does this?)

Templating / Display in plugin:
- Templating
	- with new Template API?
	- Still need to put a group together.
