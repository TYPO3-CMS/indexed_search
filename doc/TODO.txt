- Indexing configuration overview (including status and manual clearing possibility)

Bugs / Issues:
- The checkbox "No Search" in the page header is only respected by indexed_search during indexing! (A page will not be indexed when "No Search" is set). However when searching results are not filtered based on this flag - so if a page is indexed before the no search flag is set it will be found in search results. To change this is hard because the getTreeList() function that fetches all page ids cannot take a where-clause to filter it out but must have hardcoded support. Alternatively the pages table must be joined into the search result so we can select on the field. A solution is still not agreed upon.
- For tt_news with access restricted records: don't show the title of page since it can reveal information
	- SOLUTIONS: Maybe just hide search results where "resume" is normally just not shown?
- When there is a page where *content* is access restricted (eg. from a plugin) while the page itself is not, TYPO3 will still display it as a search result (not the description of course, but the title will be revealed); there should be a flag that the plugin can set so the indexer knows that the page as a whole should be indexed as if it was completely access restricted. Or maybe _all_ search results which are NOT indexed under "0,-1" should be hidden? (Reported by Lars Houmark <lars@houmark.com>)
- Seems that external media / languages are implemented buggy. See mail from Gert Thiel <GertThiel@gmx.net>, 24/2 2005

Errors encountered after spidering, maybe check:
- testsite: "message appears" - showed external media that was NOT indexed!?
- typo3site_live: Warning: phash-row "114682730" didn't have a representation in the index_section table! on references page!

Search test:
- external media respect privacy of pages?
- external media on multiple pages with DIFFERENT languages?

Templating / Display in plugin:
- Support for FE display of results in additional levels (more than level 1,2 which are hardcoded)?
- Configurable language parameter (hardcoded to "L" now)

Indexing configurations:
	- Tabel selector as a part of the section selector in the frontend.
	Config in backend through flexforms:
		- baseUrl for external files?
		- language setting for files and external URLs?

CLI feature ideas:
- Removal of old indexes
	- delete results with large tstamp (thats all....)

Backend modules:
- Much nicer detail display
- Proper skinning? / getLL? / XHTML
- The Tools>Indexing module could need some shining up and more useful features (Someone else does this?)

Ideas:
- (Jan Slusarczyk <janslu@grupaiis.pl>, 26/11 2004): Searchterms matching exact keywords on pages shows a special result/shortcut on top of result page?
- Implement that extended chars are translated: ü => u, ç => c, etc. Thus "Français" will be found when "Francais" is searched for.

Hook development:
- Example of search-SQL hook

Documentation:
- Configuration possibilities (piVars, TypoScript, Hooks etc)
- How to setup up, analyse and debug indexed search (manual)
- Technical:
	- utf-8 internally.
	- Updates on tables structure
