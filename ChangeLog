2006-02-15  Michael Stucki  <michael@typo3.org>

	* Added support for indexing Oasis/OpenDocument files
	* OpenOffice.org/OpenDocument now uses "unzip" to extract content.xml/meta.xml. Should be faster than before, and is easier to configure.

2005-10-28  Michael Stucki  <michael@typo3.org>

	* Manual update

2005-10-15  Michael Stucki  <michael@typo3.org>

	* !!! In the past, pages were marked as search hits even if a user had no access to it. This default has been changed, but the setting can be reverted by setting "show.forbiddenRecords"
	* !!! New option "show.resultNumber" for displaying the numbers of the search results. The old behavior was to display the numbers, but the default value has been changed to the opposite (0).
	* !!! The default search type has been changed to "part of word" instead of "distinct word". Please note that this will be slower than before, however it is more Google-like (=logical?) that searching for "mistak" will match "mistake", too.
	* !!! The default result layout has been changed from "sections" to "flat"
	* !!! Because of the template support, some options have been removed. You will need to adjust the layout in the template file for these settings: "tableParams.secHead", "tableParams.searchRes"
	* Added template support to indexed_search. Many thanks to Udo von Eynern for his great work!
	* Added an additional CSS based template, written by Udo van Eynern
	* Changed number of default search results from 20 to 10
	* New option "search.mediaList" for restricting the file type list when searching for files
	* Changed (fixed?) the behavior of the result counter
	* New option "show.advancedSearchLink" to hide the link to the advanced search page (default is to display the link)
	* Changed the result browser to make it more logical (=Google-like)
	* HTTP references are cut if they are too long (this could destroy the layout of the result page)

2005-05-15  Michael Stucki  <michael@typo3.org>

	* Removed some debug output in backend module

2005-05-12  Michael Stucki  <michael@typo3.org>
